Answer:[32;1m[1;3mI need to find churn reasons for customers who churned last month and break them down by reason.

First, let me determine what "last month" means. Since we need to look at the previous month relative to today, I'll need to filter churn_date accordingly.

SQLQuery: SELECT "churn_reason", COUNT(*) as churn_count
FROM "churn_events"
WHERE "churn_date" >= date('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')
AND "churn_date" < date('now', 'start of month')
GROUP BY "churn_reason"
ORDER BY churn_count DESC[0m

Answer:[32;1m[1;3mI need to find customers who churned last month and gather their characteristics including plan types, company sizes, industries, and tenure.

SQLQuery:
```sql
SELECT 
    c."name",
    c."industry",
    c."company_size",
    s."plan_type",
    ce."churn_date",
    ce."churn_reason",
    ROUND(JULIANDAY(ce."churn_date") - JULIANDAY(c."signup_date")) AS days_as_customer
FROM churn_events ce
JOIN customers c ON ce."customer_id" = c."customer_id"
JOIN subscriptions s ON ce."customer_id" = s."customer_id"
WHERE ce."churn_date" >= date('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')
    AND ce."churn_date" < date('now', 'start of month')
ORDER BY ce."churn_date" DESC
```[0m[32;1m[1;3mBased on the churn data from the last 6 months, here are the monthly churn trends:

**Monthly Churn Trends (Last 6 Months):**
- **December 2025**: 10 churned customers
- **November 2025**: 10 churned customers

**Key Findings:**
- Only 2 months show churn activity in the last 6 months (November and December 2025)
- The churn rate has remained stable at 10 customers per month for these two months
- No churn was recorded in the other 4 months of the 6-month period
- Total churned customers in the last 6 months: **20 customers**

The data shows consistent churn in the most recent two months, with no improvement or deterioration between November and December 2025.[0m

[32;1m[1;3mBased on the churn events from last month, here's the breakdown by churn reason:

1. **No longer needed** - 3 customers
2. **Missing features** - 3 customers
3. **Switching to competitor** - 2 customers
4. **Price too high** - 1 customer
5. **Poor support** - 1 customer

The top two reasons for churn last month were customers no longer needing the service and missing features (tied at 3 customers each), followed by customers switching to a competitor (2 customers). Price and support issues each accounted for 1 customer churn.[0m

Answer:[32;1m[1;3mI need to find customers who churned last month, and then get their plan types and industries.

First, let me determine what "last month" means. Since we need to find churns from last month, I'll need to filter churn_events by churn_date.

SQLQuery: SELECT DISTINCT s."plan_type", c."industry"
FROM churn_events ce
JOIN customers c ON ce."customer_id" = c."customer_id"
JOIN subscriptions s ON ce."customer_id" = s."customer_id"
WHERE ce."churn_date" >= date('now', 'start of month', '-1 month')
AND ce."churn_date" < date('now', 'start of month')

Answer:[32;1m[1;3mBased on the data, here are the churn reasons for customers who churned last month:

1. **No longer needed** - 3 customers
2. **Missing features** - 3 customers
3. **Switching to competitor** - 2 customers
4. **Price too high** - 1 customer
5. **Poor support** - 1 customer

The most common reasons for churn last month were customers no longer needing the service and missing features (tied at 3 customers each), followed by customers switching to a competitor (2 customers).[0m

[32;1m[1;3mBased on the query results, customers who churned last month had the following plan types and industries:

1. **Pro plan** - Finance industry
2. **Pro plan** - Technology industry
3. **Enterprise plan** - Healthcare industry
4. **Enterprise plan** - Finance industry
5. **Basic plan** - Technology industry

The churned customers were spread across three plan types (Pro, Enterprise, and Basic) and three industries (Finance, Technology, and Healthcare).[0m
